Included in each csv the orientations of each grain for all steps of the given
simulation. The file name for the cubic domain follows the format:

DOM_CUB_NSLIP_[a]_SET_[b]_ANISO_[c]

Where,
a is the number of slip systems altered
b is the random set of slip systems
c is the percentage of the base strength the altered slip systems have

For the elongated domain this becomes DOM_ELONG_NSLIP_[a]_SET_[b]_ANISO_[c].

The first column of each file is the grain ID with every three columns after
following the format

STEP_[n]_ROD_1, STEP_[n]_ROD_2, STEP_[n]_ROD_3

where n is the step at which the orientations are recorded (0-26) and
ROD_1, ROD_2, and ROD_3 are the components of the Rodrigues vector at that step.

These files were generated using the pandas library and as such can be easily
traversed using the pd.read_csv("[file_name].csv") function.
e.g. Data["STEP_n_ROD_2][19] will give the nth step second component of the
Rodrigues vector for grain 20
